Hello, I'm Harriet, a PhD student at Monash University where I am currently supervised by Di Cook, Sarah Goodwin, and Susan Vanderplus. My main research interest is visual statistics, but I often end up drifting towards whatever interests me. 

This is public website that I use to share some of my work (and opinions). If you are looking for my [Github](https://github.com/harriet-mason) so that you can complain to me about my software, you are in the wrong place. If you want to hear *me* complain about my software, you are in the right place.
