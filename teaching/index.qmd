# ETC3250 Tutorial Help Sheet
I have found that students struggle to know where to start with tutorial questions. These files provide simple hints that should help to get started on questions without providing answers. I STRONGLY recommend doing the tutorial questions without this help sheet if possible to simulate an exam situation. This is a step between doing the question entirely by yourself and just watching me do the question.
